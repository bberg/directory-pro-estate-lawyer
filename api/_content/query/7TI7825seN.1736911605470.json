However, a will simply provides instructions on how the deceased's assets should be distributed. Probate is the legal process of validating the will and carrying out these instructions. Without probate, transferring the title to property or confirming the official executor can become challenging. While some may avoid probate through strategic estate planning, such as setting up a trust, a will alone often doesn't eliminate the need for this process.
