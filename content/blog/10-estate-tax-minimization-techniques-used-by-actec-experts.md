# 10 Estate Tax Minimization Techniques Used by ACTEC Experts

Estate tax can impose a significant burden on an inherited estate, but there are strategies available to mitigate its impact. Here we explore ten advanced techniques favored by members of the [American College of Trust and Estate Counsel (ACTEC)](/dir/the_american_college_of_trust_and_estate_counsel) to reduce estate taxes:

1. **Grantor Retained Annuity Trusts (GRATs):** GRATs allow you to transfer appreciating assets to beneficiaries with minimal gift tax consequences by retaining an annuity interest.

2. **Charitable Remainder Trusts (CRTs):** These trusts provide a fixed income stream for life or a term of years and allow the remainder to pass to a charity, offering both income and estate tax benefits.

3. **Family Limited Partnerships (FLPs):** FLPs can be an effective way to transfer wealth while retaining control over assets, with valuation discounts further reducing taxable estate value.

4. **Irrevocable Life Insurance Trusts (ILITs):** By placing life insurance in an ILIT, the death benefit is excluded from the insured’s estate, reducing estate taxes.

5. **Dynasty Trusts:** These long-term trusts allow wealth to pass from generation to generation without incurring estate taxes at each death.

6. **Qualified Personal Residence Trusts (QPRTs):** A QPRT allows you to remove a primary or secondary residence from your estate at a reduced gift tax cost while continuing to occupy it.

7. **Gifts and Annual Exclusion:** Utilizing the annual gift tax exclusion and lifetime gift exemption can reduce the taxable estate significantly.

8. **Tax-Advantaged Investments:** Shifting to certain investments can provide tax-deferred growth, which reduces the size of the estate for tax purposes.

9. **Generation-Skipping Transfer (GST) Tax Exemption:** Proper use of your GST exemption can prevent double taxation across generations.

10. **Valuation Discounts:** In certain cases, applying valuation discounts for minority interests or lack of marketability can reduce the value of gifts or estates.
