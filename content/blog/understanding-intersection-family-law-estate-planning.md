So, how do these two fields intersect, and what steps can you take to manage them effectively? Here, we delve into the intricacies and offer useful tips for navigating these intersections.

## Key Considerations

**Divorce and Estate Planning**

Divorce can have profound effects on your estate plan. During this stressful time, reviewing and revising your estate planning documents is critical.
